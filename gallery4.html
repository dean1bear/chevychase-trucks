     <P>Engine, Transmission, and Performance
        A range of engines—including a turbocharged four-cylinder, to a pair of V-8s, and a Duramax
        diesel 3.0-liter inline-six—means there's a Silverado 1500 powertrain for any job or adventure.
        The 6.2-liter V-8 makes 420 horsepower while the smaller 5.3-liter makes 355 horsepower. The
        turbocharged 2.7-liter four-cylinder makes 310 horsepower, and the diesel makes 277. Every
        version of the Silverado we've driven felt smaller than its size suggests. The truck's handling is
        surprisingly agile, and the brake pedal provides firm and reassuring feedback. Those looking for
        a more rugged half-ton Silverado will appreciate the Trail Boss model. It features a 2.0-inch lift,
        gnarly tires, and other upgrades that make taking the path less traveled easier and more
        entertaining.
        0-60-MPH Times
        With the larger 6.2-liter V-8, the Silverado High Country we tested hit 60 mph in just 5.4 seconds.
        For comparison, the smaller 355-hp 5.3-liter needed 6.1 seconds. The diesel-powered Silverado
        we tested had the slowest acceleration of the bunch, but we were impressed by the engine's
        smooth and quiet operation.
        With a max towing capacity of 13,300 pounds, the half-ton Silverado is a seriously capable
        hauler. It beats the Ram 1500's max-tow rating by 550 pounds but trails the F-150's by 700.
        Chevy's top tow rating is accessible with the 6.2-liter V-8, but the 5.3-liter version can still handle
        as much as 11,500 pounds. Models with the turbocharged four-cylinder can tow up to 9,500
        pounds. The Chevy pickup's powertrains matter less when it comes to payload, which rang
        . The optional diesel is the most economical, with EPA estimates of up to 23 mpg city and 33
        mpg. With four-wheel drive, its highway rating drops down to 26 mpg, which we matched on our
        75-mph fuel-economy route. Meanwhile, the gas-fed turbo-four with four-wheel drive is rated at
        up to 20 mpg city and 22 highway. The thriftiest 5.3-liter V-8, four-wheel-drive powertrain is rated
        up to 16 mpg in the city and 22 mpg on the highway; our real-world testing revealed that it was
        actually more efficient than the Silverado's smallest engine, the turbocharged four-cylinder: in
        our testing the V-8 achieved 21 mpg whereas the turbo-four returned 18 mpg. The 6.2-liter V-8
        has city/highway estimates of up to 16/21 mpg, and on our real-world highway test it also
        proved impressively easy on fuel compared with the turbo-four by delivering 19 mpg. For more
        information about the Silverado's fuel economy, </P>
